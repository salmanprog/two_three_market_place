# Resell Product Fix - COMPLETED ✅

## Problem Identified and Fixed
The resell product functionality was failing for some products because of a **repository method bug**.

### Root Cause
The `findByResellProductId()` method in `Modules/Seller/Repositories/ProductRepository.php` was incorrectly implemented:

```php
// WRONG - was looking for seller_product where product_id = $id
return $this->product::with('skus')->where('product_id',$id)->firstOrFail();

// CORRECT - should look for seller_product where id = $id
return $this->product::with('skus')->findOrFail($id);
```

### The Issue Explained
- When clicking "resell product" for seller_product ID 6, the method tried to find a seller_product where `product_id = 6`
- But seller_product ID 6 actually has `product_id = 9` (it references main product 9)
- So the query returned null, causing "Product not found" error

## Changes Made

### 1. **MAIN FIX**: Repository Method (Modules/Seller/Repositories/ProductRepository.php)
```php
public function findByResellProductId($id){
    // Fixed: Find seller_product by its ID, not by product_id
    return $this->product::with('skus')->findOrFail($id);
}
```

### 2. Template Fix (resources/views/frontend/amazy/pages/profile/order.blade.php)
- Simplified to always pass seller_product ID for both single and variant products
- Removed unnecessary conditional logic

### 3. Form Fix (resources/views/frontend/amazy/pages/profile/resell_product_form.blade.php)
- Removed duplicate product_id inputs
- Added proper field separation

### 4. Controller Simplification (app/Http/Controllers/ResellProduct.php)
- Removed complex fallback logic since repository method now works correctly
- Simplified the resellProduct() method

## Testing Results ✅

**Before Fix:**
- `http://localhost/tow-three-ld-last-copy/resell-product/6` → "Product not found" error
- `http://localhost/tow-three-ld-last-copy/resell-product/1` → Worked fine

**After Fix:**
- `http://localhost/tow-three-ld-last-copy/resell-product/6` → ✅ Loads resell form correctly
- `http://localhost/tow-three-ld-last-copy/resell-product/1` → ✅ Still works fine

## Summary
The issue was a simple but critical bug in the repository method that was using the wrong field for the database query. The fix ensures that all seller_product IDs work correctly for the resell functionality, regardless of whether they are single or variant products.
